  "A buffer could be considered a slider (see slider) with
  some extra attributes, besides attributes to keep track
  of name, filename, dirtyness, undo information it consists
  of

    * A slider
    * A highlighter function
    * A keymap

  The slider is used to keep track of the text, the highlighter
  function is used by the view to apply highlight and the
  keymap is used to decide which function a keypress should
  be mapped to.

  On runtime the highlighter function and the keymap can be
  replaced.
  
  The buffer structure is immutable, so every operation that
  changes the buffer will return a new one."
